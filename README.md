# Jeremiah Torbit's Portfolio

## Description

Provided no source code, built application for professional portfolio. Ensured that there were sections including: About Me, My Work and Contact Me. Created links to successfully navigate to the aforementioned sections. Previous work images were linked to the deployed pages on Github. The application is screen adaptive to be viewable on multiple screen sizes and devices.

Ultimately, created a fully functional professional portfolio application by applying semantic HTML structure and newly learned CSS styles and media queries.
