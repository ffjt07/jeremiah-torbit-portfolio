                    Hello and welcome! My name is Jeremiah Torbit and I am passionate about 
                    solving problems and bringing development ideas into interactive and usable  
                    applications. I am certified in Full Stack development, have my Executive MBA 
                    from Colorado State University and my Bachelor of Science in Business Management. 
                    I also have over 12 years of financial and investment industry experience.
                    When I am not working on collaborative and strategic projects, I am a volunteer 
                    firefighter, enjoy playing both ice and roller hockey and getting outside and exploring 
                    the great outdoors. I am excited for you to explore the rest of my portfolio and look 
                    forward to collaborating with you.
